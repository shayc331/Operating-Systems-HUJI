REMARKS:
Still very fun exercise, learned a lot.

ANSWERS:

Q1:
We would opt to use user-level threads whenever we would like to be responsible for our threads scheduling, context
switches, etc' instead of leaving the task to the OS and by that reducing the overhead. Moreover, if we know our threads
will not access any I/O devices, it is reasonable to use user-level threads since (If there is an I/O access,
the OS will halt the entire process instead of just the current running thread).


Q2:
The main advantages of creating a new process for each tab are being able to perform parallel run of multiple tabs at
once, and if a tab executes a system-call, other could still be running.
The main disadvantages of this method executed by Google Chrome are increased overhead, leading to slower performance,
and damages the tabs ability to communicate with each other.


Q3:
First, the terminal awaits a keyboard response. Then the keyboard sends a response to the OS and the OS forwards this
command to the terminal. When this operation ends, the terminal executes the 'kill' command and sends a SIGTERM signal
with the given ID to the OS to perform. The OS will sends the signal to the 'shotwell' to kill itself. (if it doesnt
kill itself, the os get the job done).


Q4:
Real time is used to count real world seconds, used for example in PC clock.
Virtual time is used by the OS or internal PC parts, to perform 'tick' operations. Every machine may use different
virtual time. Used for example in scheduling decisions.
